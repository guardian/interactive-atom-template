        <p>It was really, really hot on the moon, 200 degrees Fahrenheit. We needed protection. We were wearing new-fangled, water-cooled uniforms and didn't know how long the coolant would last.
          We didn't know how far we could go in our space suits. NASA wanted us to conduct our experiments in front of a fixed camera.
          We cheated just a little, and very briefly bounded off to take pictures of some interesting bedrock.</p>

        <p>I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth." President John F. Kennedy announces his intention to put a man on the Moon before a joint session of Congress on May 25 1961</p>
